## GitHub Issues

We're currently experiencing issues pushing the project to GitHub due to large files in the node_modules directory. In the next session, we should:

1. Create a fresh clone of the repository
2. Copy only the necessary source files (excluding node_modules)
3. Ensure .gitignore is properly set up before installing dependencies
4. Push the clean repository to GitHub

## Important Files

- `/niche_research/niche_analysis.md`: Contains analysis of the selected niche
- `/site_structure/`: Contains content categories, site map, and wireframes
- `/frontend/src/components/`: Contains implemented React components
- `/frontend/src/app/`: Contains Next.js pages

## Monetization Strategy

The site will generate passive income through:
1. Affiliate links to course platforms (Udemy, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, etc.)
2. Display advertising once traffic reaches sufficient levels
3. Email marketing with affiliate offers

## Design Decisions

- Using Next.js for SEO benefits and server-side rendering
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Blue color scheme to convey trust and professionalism
- Clean, modern layout focused on readability and conversion
